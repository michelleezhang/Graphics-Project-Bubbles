# Graphics-Project-Bubbles

This project consists of a rigid sphere and assemblies of rigid 3D parts – an anemone and five clownfish – located on a ground plane at z = 0. 
The anemone spins, and its tentacles sway. There are several components that the user can interact with. 
Users can drag their mouse on the screen to rotate one of the fish. 
World coordinate axes and coordinate axes for the rotatable fish and sphere are shown. 
The canvas size automatically adjusts when the browser is resized. Two viewports are displayed onscreen. 
The left viewport features a perspective camera, and the right viewport features an orthographic camera. 
The arrow keys will move the camera without rotating it. 
The up and down arrow keys move the camera forwards and backwards respectively in the gaze direction. 
The right and left arrow keys “strafe” the camera right and left respectively at the current height. 
The W, A, S, and D keys will aim the camera to look up, left, down, and right respectively without moving the camera. 
Pressing the “Spin <<” button on the screen will spin the anemone faster to the left, 
while pressing the “Spin >>” button on the screen will spin the anemone faster to the right. 
An input box is provided on the screen to allow users to adjust the initial rotation angle of the anemone’s tentacles, 
causing them to curl and unfurl from a different initial configuration, depending on the number inputted. 
In order to use this feature, users should type a number into the box and press the “Submit” button. 
There are also checkboxes provided for three components of the project: the anemone base, the anemone tentacles, and the fish. 
Checking (and unchecking) these boxes allows the user to pause (and unpause) the movement of the selected component.
